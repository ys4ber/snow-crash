#----------------------leve00----------------------

user=level00
password=level00

the password is given in the subject to start the journey of SNOW-CRASH


we are in the user level00 so i have to look for the password of flag00 , 
the idea is to look for all files that is owned by the user ``` flag00 ``` with this way i found two files ,
i wont share with you the name of the files , so you have to do some research to found them ,
if you notice , the files have the same content .
now you have to figure out what to do with this "encypted" password haha


---------------------- flag00 ----------------------

now after you are in flag00 user , run the command ``` getflag ```
so you can get the flag ( the password for level01 )

--------------------- level01 --------------------

you are in the user level01 , you have to look for flag01's password 
first thing if you check the file passwd in /etc
you will find that the password is writed there , they didnt hide it 
now all what you have to do is decrypt it using "the right tool"


--------------------- flag01 --------------------

now after you are in flag01 user , run the command ``` getflag ```
so you can get the flag ( the password for level03 )



--------------------- level02 --------------------

now you are here . they gave you a simple file .pcap , to analyze this file you need to use some tools like tcpdump, tcpflow , wireshark ... , the idea is to get the password from this logs.
